# Learning NGINX 

Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t9Mp0BGnyI) tutorial by Laith Academy

I did this on a window machine, I downloaded NGINX from [this](https://nginx.org/en/docs/windows.html) website

After downloading NGINX and unzipping it, you can start NGINX by opening a CMD to the directory where nginx.exe is located, and running the command
```
start nginx
```

To follow along with the tutorial we are modifying the nginx.conf file found at {nginx_installation_folder}/conf/nginx.conf, but to have it all in the same place I will copy the file to this repo after finishing the guide. 

## **NOTE: the nginx.conf file found here MUST be inside the directory where you have downloaded NGINX if you want it to work.**
